2018-03-11 Added complex C in numeric font (U+2102) and modified 49
           characters (made 18 lower case letters narrower, lifted 16
           numeric indices, plus some small changes). Modified 14
           characters in standard font (2, l, t, 1/2, 1/4, ...,
           sigma, ...). Each modified character is marked by a blue
           pixel top right outside of its bitmap.

           improved. Generated the new WP43S_StandardFont.ttf

2018-09-17 Duplicated character U+2064 on U+2027. I don't know why
           U+2064 isn't visible! The name of that char is "INVISIBLE
           PLUS" that may be an explanation. So use U+2027 insteed of
           U+2064. Generated the new WP43S_StandardFont.ttf
