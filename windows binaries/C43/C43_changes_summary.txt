C43 Changes from the WP43S


HP42S inspired:

Primary and f key layout a reminder to HP42S and DM42.
BASE menu with HEX, DEC, etc. and short integer shortcuts, and A-F.
LastX on keyboard.
Stack displays X..T have constant digit size.
Settings in the MODE and DISP menus, duplicated in WP43S system flags.
Setting status displayed on soft menu buttons, i.e. on/off, selected, or value.
WP 43S system flags indicate current state and can be directly changed.

Large digits where possible:

SHOW displays large digits when possible. 
Stack display always uses large digits for all numbers.
SHOW changes to small font size for very long integers.
SHOW and stack use small font size for alphanumeric text, due to limited large characters available.

Shift savers:

The 14 yellow math functions f[Σ+] through f[X<>Y] are accessible without shift by long press.
Soft menu f and g items are accessible by long press of the FN key with an underline indicating the function selected.
Double tap backspace does CLX.
Long press backspace does CLSTK.
Long press XEQ does the XEQM menu.
With no soft menu present, FN keys do the yellow text underneath (I>, y^x, x^2, 10^x, e^x & x√y).
With no soft menu present, Up/Dn goes to SHOW and scrolls through the registers X, Y,...L.
Triple click shift button does the HOME menu.
Long press shift button cycles f, g & HOME menu.

Single shift f/g: 

One press for f, two presses for g, three presses within the second for HOME.
Alternative layout on the bezel plate with f on COS and g on TAN.

KEYS menu:

KEYS, new C43 soft menu for assigned keys, 
Pre-set key assignment layouts with shift keys and alpha keys options.
Pre-set key assignment layouts for DM42, V43, WP43S and C43 ALT key layouts.
Σ+ key assignment in both normal and in user modes.

XEQM menu:

XEQM, new C43 soft menu, accessed by long press of XEQ.
Custom menu with 18 user soft menu items.
Configured by basic RPN script in 18 text files.
Scripting includes GOTO, XEQ, DSZ & ISZ looping functions.
Configuration by 18 text files in the PROGRAMS folder on the flash drive. 
XEQM independent from WP 43S “MyMenu”, which will also be supported. 

HOME menu:

HOME, new C43 soft menu, accessed by shift key and g[7].
HOME menu combines useful functions together in one menu.
Four softmenu screens with useful interactive mode functions grouped together.
SI prefix shortcut multipliers f, p, µ, m, k, M, G, T.
Keyboard help: keyboard functions mirrored in soft menus in three ways.
Useful also for DM42 without labels.

STAT: 

Σ+ entry stores 400 x,y pairs for plotting (16 digit reals to save space).
Σ+ entry recorded in tab separated TSV files in the DATA folder on the flash drive.
LISTXY function shows the last 10 x,y pairs entered.
Σ+ key can be re-configured. Σ- key is replaced with I>. Both Σ+ and Σ-- are available in STAT menu.

General:

g[Dn] FLGS browser shows all 100 global flags at once.
Up/Dn in flags browser cycles to the new STATUS screens.
DISP: SIG n displays n+1 significant digits (eg. 𝛑/100 in SIG2 shows 0.031 4, compared to FIX2 which shows 0.03).
DISP: UNIT n postfixes SI multipliers (f, p, µ, m, k, M, G, T) to the stack display (eg. 𝛑/100 in UNIT2 shows 31.4 m).
Soft menus contain all functions, including those located on the keyboard.
Intuitive grouping of binary/hex digits while entering numbers.
Setting for large or small digit font.
Double click on FN for g[FN].
eRPN setting, like the new style RPN on HP20B and 30B (eRPN does not duplicate X upon entry, like RPL does).

Error savers:

>R & >P does not error if X contains a complex number, instead it sets the POLAR flag accordingly, i.e. changes RECT/POLAR mode.
>I rounds reals and allows rounding of integers without error.
Angle (arg) is allowed for reals or integer numbers without error.

Functions:

>I key added in place of Σ-, rounds and toggles between long and short integer types. 
d.ms key on g[LOG] changed to .ms, which toggles between d.ms, h.ms and the current angular mode (not working yet).
d.ms moved to MODE, to be together with DEG, RAD, etc.
EE function menus including star/delta, sequence components, 3-phase impedances, all operating on either real or complex numbers. Requests for custom menus for other disciplines welcome.
