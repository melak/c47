This is a very early version of the WP43S program for DM42. Use it at your own risk.  

Many things simply do not work! You will have to press reset quite often.  

Installation instructions:  
Copy the keymap.bin file to the DM42 flash disk over USB. This is meant to relocate keys to match the WP43S layout.  
Copy the WP43S.pgm file to the DM42 flash disk over USB.  
Flash the WP43S.pgm file just like SDKdemo.pgm (https://github.com/swissmicros/SDKdemo)  
From free42: select [shift][SETUP][5][2][4][3] WP43S.pgm [ENTER][ENTER] wait [EXIT][EXIT]  

The keyboard layout is also that of WP43S when navigating in the system part of the DM42 (thanks to the keymap.bin file)

The Key_stickers.xcf and WP43S_overlay.xcf are GIMP image files to make your life easier!

To leave the WP43S program: in the menu [g][MODE][up] select [g][SYSTEM] ([g][F1]) to return to the DMCP system.
