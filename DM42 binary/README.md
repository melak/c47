The keyboard layout is also that of WP43S when navigating in the system part of the DM42 (thanks to the keymap.bin file)
  
To leave the WP43S program: in the menu [g][MODE][up] select [g][SYSTEM] ([g][F1]) to return to the DMCP system.
  
To retrieve the original DM42 keyboard layout: copy the file **original_DM42_keymap.bin** to the DM42 flash disk, rename it **keymap.bin** and reset the DM42. More informations here: http://www.swissmicros.com/dm42/devel/dmcp_devel_manual/
