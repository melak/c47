This is a very early version of the WP43S program for DM42. Use it at your own risk.  

Many things simply do not work! You will have to press reset quite often.  

Installation instructions:  
Copy the WP43S.pgm file to the DM42 flash disk over USB.  
Flash the WP43S.pgm file just like SDKdemo.pgm (https://github.com/swissmicros/SDKdemo)  
From free42: select [shift][SETUP][5][2][4][3] WP43S.pgm [ENTER][ENTER] wait [EXIT][EXIT]  

The keyboard layout is that of the WP43S as long as you stay in this program.  
Outside WP43S the DM42 keyboard is valid.  
To leave the WP43S program: in the menu [g][MODE][up] select [g][SYSTEM] ([g][F1]) to return to the DMCP system.
